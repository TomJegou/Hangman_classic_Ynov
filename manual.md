## Launch the application ##

If it's your first time starting the application, and you have build the app (if not, refer to the [README.md](README.md) and go to the install and build section),
you just need to execute the excecutable file in the bin folder.

```
./bin/executable_name
```

Good job ! You are now in the game's main menu, let's start !
